<img width="655" height="381" alt="Untitled design" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a772a8bf-0f98-4372-abf4-ac712af79018" />

## Introduction:
This project analyses two years of store- and product-level sales data (2022 vs 2023) for Maven Toys to surface the strategic story behind the numbers. The problem: raw sales figures alone can hide margin erosion, shifting seasonality, and persistent store-level weaknesses that quietly eat into profitability. 

By comparing year-on-year performance and segmenting by product, category, month, and store age, the analysis reveals which products and stores consistently drive profit, which SKUs underperform, and where targeted operational or assortment changes will have the most impact. The goal is to convert transactional data into clear, repeatable actions—so retail teams can protect margin, optimize inventory, and prioritise growth investments.

## Key Metrics:
1.💰 Revenue – How did sales change year-on-year?

2. 📈 Profit – Did the business actually make more money?
   
3. 📊 Margins – Are we running more efficiently or less?
   
4. 🛒 Orders – Was revenue loss from fewer orders or smaller baskets?
   
5. 🏬 Stores – What’s the average revenue per store?
   
6. 🎯 Top Products – Which products drive most of the revenue?
   
7. ⚖️ Profitability – Which products add profit vs. drain it?
   
8. 📅 Seasonality – When are the true peak months?
   
9. 🏢 Store Segments – Do older stores really perform better?
    
10.🚨 Underperformers – Who’s consistently dragging results down?

### Analysis:

### Total Revenue (by year): 

Total revenue captures the overall sales volume for each year. Maven Toys generated $7.48M in 2022 but slipped to $6.96M in 2023, showing a noticeable dip in top-line growth. This decline highlights a potential slowdown in demand or challenges in sustaining prior sales levels. Tracking this metric year-on-year ensures the business can detect early signs of stagnation.

### Profit / Net Profit (absolute):

Profit reflects how much of the revenue actually translates into earnings after costs. The company made $2.19M in 2022 but only $1.82M in 2023, a drop that outpaces the revenue decline. This signals rising costs or less efficient operations eating into earnings. It’s a critical measure because revenue growth without profit growth is unsustainable.

### Profit Margin (%):

Margins show the efficiency of converting sales into profit. Maven Toys went from 29.3% in 2022 to 26.2% in 2023, losing over 3 percentage points in profitability. This downward trend suggests cost pressures or poor pricing strategies. Sustained margin erosion reduces flexibility for reinvestment and competitive positioning.

### Orders / Transaction Count:

Orders indicate sales volume and can explain whether dips in revenue are due to fewer transactions or smaller basket sizes. The company processed 421K orders in 2022 compared to 408K in 2023. Although the decline is slight, it still means fewer customers or transactions year-on-year. This metric complements revenue trends by revealing underlying demand patterns.

### Average Revenue per Store:

This metric normalizes sales across the store network, showing store-level health. Average revenue per store dropped from $149.6K in 2022 to $139.2K in 2023. The decrease implies that even with a similar number of stores, individual store contributions weakened. It raises questions about localized demand, store management, or inventory efficiency.

### Product Revenue Share (cumulative % of revenue):

This measure identifies which products dominate company revenue. In 2022, Chutes & Ladders and Uno Card Game led sales, while in 2023, Chutes & Ladders, Mini Basketball Loop, and Classic Dominoes took the lead. At the bottom, products like Monopoly and Mr. Potatohead contributed negligible revenue. Understanding this distribution is crucial for inventory and SKU rationalization.

### SKU Profitability:

Looking at profit margins per product highlights where the company truly earns. Across both years, items like Colorbuds consistently delivered high profitability, while products such as Barrel O’ Slime, Hot Wheels 5-Pack, and PlayDoh Toolkit dragged performance. This shows revenue leaders are not always profit leaders. Retailers must weigh both sides when making stocking decisions.

### Seasonality / Monthly Revenue:

Seasonal peaks drive retail success, but they shift year-to-year. In 2022, December, April, and May were strongest months, while in 2023, peaks came in March, July, and April. Lows also varied, with August (2022) and September (2023) being weak performers. Retailers must remain flexible, adjusting stock and campaigns based on shifting demand cycles.

### Store Segmentation by Age & Performance:

Stores were segmented by age—Young, Mid, and Mature—to see if longevity predicts success. Surprisingly, top performers spanned all age groups: e.g., Ciudad de México 2 (a standout) and Guadalajara 3 showed that management and positioning matter more than store age. This insight challenges the assumption that older stores always outperform younger ones. Performance is about quality, not just history.

### Consistent Underperformers / Outliers:

A few stores repeatedly ranked at the bottom: Durango 1, Cuernavaca, Campeche 2, Tolucaz, and La Paz 1. Their average revenues hovered around ~$100K in both years, with no sign of improvement. This consistency signals deeper structural issues like weak local demand, poor execution, or mismatched product mix. Identifying these underperformers is vital for targeted intervention rather than broad company-wide fixes.

## Conclusion:

The analysis shows that Maven Toys experienced a slight dip in both revenue ($7.48M → $6.96M) and profitability ($2.19M → $1.82M) from 2022 to 2023, alongside a drop in profit margin efficiency (29.3% → 26.2%). Orders also declined, suggesting a volume issue rather than just pricing. Strong-performing SKUs like Colorbuds and Lego Bricks continue to drive most of the revenue, while a long tail of underperforming products drags overall profitability. Certain stores, such as Durango 1 and Cuernavaca, consistently underperform, while others like Ciudad de México 2 and Guadalajara 3 set the benchmark. Seasonal patterns remain critical, with peaks in December and March, but slight shifts year-on-year highlight the need for adaptive planning.

## Recommendations (Priority Actions):

#### Double down on winners: Secure availability and marketing support for top-performing SKUs; avoid stockouts in peak months.

#### Rationalize low performers: Review and act on the weakest SKUs (promote, replace, or delist). Factor in carrying costs when making decisions.

#### Fix underperforming stores: Audit and pilot interventions in problem stores before scaling improvements.

#### Plan for seasonality: Align inventory and promotions with seasonal demand (Dec, Mar, Apr–Jun clusters), updating dynamically each year.

#### Boost SKU margin visibility: Monitor and act on product-level profitability, renegotiating terms or repricing where necessary.

#### Automate performance tracking: Deploy live dashboards with alerts for margin drops, revenue declines, or inventory risks.

#### Replicate best practices: Transfer winning strategies from top stores into mid and low performers.

#### Test before scaling: Use experiments (pricing, bundling, local marketing) and measure impact via A/B methods to avoid costly blanket decisions.
